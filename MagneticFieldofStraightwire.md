## Magnetic Field of Straight wire

It is understood that a moving charge or current generates a magnetic field. A long straight wire carrying a current I is 
shown in diagram below. The presence of current in the wire creates a magnetic field around it which consist of concentric
circles.

The strength of magnetic field, B, can be found at a distance r away from the wire by the equation below:
$\displaystyle{B}=\frac{{\mu_{{0}}{I}}}{{{2}\pi{r}}}$
where, $\displaystyle\mu_{{0}}$ is a constant known as permeability of free space and has the 
value $\displaystyle\mu_{{0}}={4}\pi\cdot{10}^{ -{{7}}}{T}\cdot\frac{m}{{A}}$
It should be noted that the distance r must be measured perpendicular to the wire.
So, The magnetic field produced by a long, straight wire consists of concentric circles centered around the wire, 
with the direction of the field determined by the right-hand rule: point your thumb in the direction of the current, 
and your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field at any point around the wire; the field strength is
inversely proportional to the distance from the wire.
Key Points: 
1. Shape of field lines: Concentric circles around the wire.
2. Direction determination: Right-hand rule - point your thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers curl in 
the direction of the magnetic field.
3. Strength dependence: The magnetic field strength decreases as the distance from the wire increases
